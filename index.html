    <div class="title flash">Projects</div>
    Here are some of the projects that I  have worked on:
	You can find the code for each one on my 
    <a href="https://github.com/TewariSagar">GitHub</a>.

      <ul id="press">    
		<li> <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RuSZYWIk00&t=6s"> Email Spam Filtering </a>: Implemented and compared the accuracy of various machine learning algorithms to classify an email as a spam or a ham. The algorithms
			implemented were Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest algorithms.
		<li><a href="https://github.com/TewariSagar/TewariSagar.github.io">Personal Website </a> : Created my personal website www dot sagartewari dot com using HTML, CSS, javascript and jQuery. This website will be updated regularly as I complete more projects.</li>
        <li>MIPS Simulator : Created a Java program that shows the step by step working of a Petri Net simulator. It displayed working of fetch, decode, load, store and add functions on 32-bit instructions </li>
        <li><a href = ""https://github.com/TewariSagar/ADS-Spring-2015>Routing Scheme Using Binary Trie </a> :
            Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm using Fibonacci Heap in Java. Then modified the algorithm so as
            find the shortest path between two IP addresses in the routing scheme using Binary Trie.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/TewariSagar/BitTorrentRepo">Peer to Peer Network </a> :
            Implemented an application similar to Bit-torrent using Socket Programming in Java. First peer splits a file into small chunks of 32 KB each and shares the chunks with other incoming peers. Used multi-threading to send chunks to peers by sockets. Peers would then then exchange chunks between them with multiple downloading threads and multiple uploading threads.</li>
        <li>Dictionary Based Code Compression and Decompression :
            Implemented a Dictionary based code compression and decompression algorithm, which takes 32 codes from an input file and compresses it on the basis of a dictionary (contains 8 entries on the basis of their frequency in input file) and using 4 encoding techniques (Direct Match ,No Match , 2-Bit Consecutive Mismatch , 2-bit Anywhere Mismatch).
            The other part of the project decompresses the given compressed file thus retrieving the original text</li>
        <li><a href = "https://github.com/TewariSagar/UnixShell">Korn-like Unix shell built in C </a>:
            Successfully implemented Enviroment Variable Expansion Lex file Yacc file alias alias name word unalias name setenv variable word printenv unsetenv variable cd cd word_directory_name reading in and executing file bye metacharacters white space multi token arguments some error handling wildcard matching alias executes | piping parses string and executes commands</li>
